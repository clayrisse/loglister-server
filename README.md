## Description

This is an lister / logger app that manages a variety of list types. The app is meant to be shared and follow by others as well as coedited by selected people.

## User Stories

- **404:** As an anon/user I can see a 404 page if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault

- **Signup:** As an anon I can sign up in the app so that I can start planning and listing

- **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can list log and share instructions

- **Logout:** As a user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use my account. 

- **Edit profile:** As a user I can add my picture and change my account information.

  

- **Dashboard**: As a User I can see the listing of my lists, and special items I haven't marked as done or that are due for the day.

- **Search:** we can do it by a key word in the item title or the list name. 

  

- **Add Lists** As a user I can add theme lists/logs

- **Edit Lists** As a user I can edit list , change their privacy, add co-editors, change background through an API, and **delete** them.

- **Add Editors:** As list owners we could invite other users to collaborate or share a list.

- **Co-Editors:** we could add, edit and delete any item in the list we share. Also we could stop subscribing to the list.

  

- **Add Items:** As a user I can add items  an mark them as checked.
